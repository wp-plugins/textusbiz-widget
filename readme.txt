== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this serve the same function as live chat? =   

No. This is not an online chat. You can use the tab to have a visitor start a text message conversation with you. The conversation stays purely SMS and the interactions go from cell phone to your Messages dashboard. 
 
= Can I install a floating tab or a button? =  

Both! You can choose the tab or button type from within your Messages account settings in the widget section.   

= When I reply to a visitor, where does the text go? =  

The text will go straight to the visitor’s cell phone. When they reply back, the message will appear in the Messages dashboard.
