TextUs.Biz - Messages for Small Business Web to Text Widget 

== Description ==

This plugin allows users of TextUs.Biz - Messages for Small Business to embed a widget not their WordPress website in order to allow visitors of the website to initiate a text conversation with the business. 

== Installation ==

Simply be adding two lines of code to your website . . . your customers can click on a “TextUs” tab, enter their cell phone number and send you message that will instantly pop up in your TextUs.Biz application. When you respond back, it goes directly to the customer’s phone as a text message! 

1. To add this to your site, simply log into your Messages account, click on the down arrow next to your phone number, and choose account settings.   
2. From here, you have the option to choose between our Floating Tab option or the static Button option. Simply choose the style you would like to use.   
3. Paste the code snippet into the proper section of your website. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this serve the same function as live chat? =   

No. This is not an online chat. You can use the tab to have a visitor start a text message conversation with you. The conversation stays purely SMS and the interactions go from cell phone to your Messages dashboard. 
 
= Can I install a floating tab or a button? =  

Both! You can choose the tab or button type from within your Messages account settings in the widget section.   

= When I reply to a visitor, where does the text go? =  

The text will go straight to the visitor’s cell phone. When they reply back, the message will appear in the Messages dashboard.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
